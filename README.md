# Lord_Dampnut2

Hi

This code will change Donald Trump to Lord Dampnut in Chrome browsers. This is just for a laugh. Enjoy.

Copy the .js and .json into a folder then open by going to the Chrome extension directory chrome://extensions/ and select "developer mode" then click on "unpack extension" and select the folder.

Be good to one another. Peace.
