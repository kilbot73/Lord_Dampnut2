# Lord_Dampnut2

Hi

This code will change Donald Trump to Lord Dampnut in Chrome browsers. This is just for a laugh. Enjoy.

Download the files as a .zip by clicking the green button up there.

Copy the files into a folder then open that folder by going to the Chrome extension directory chrome://extensions/ .

While you are in chrome://extensions/ select "developer mode" then click on "unpack extension" and select the same folder you just unpacked the files to.

Be excellent to each another. Peace.
